Introduction
The ByteFreq Data Profiler is a tool that allows you to gain insight into the quality of your data through profiling the data formats of each field in your files.  It is an enabling tool, which provides the primary research needed to drive automated data quality engines downstream.


What it does
The profiler reads in your file based data, and column by column converts the data item level contents into a generalised pattern-string that helps to characterise the format of the data held in each column. It then can output this as raw data, or it can track the frequency of each pattern found per column in an associative array to generate frequency counts that summarise the content of your data file, field by field. 


The software enables three outputs necessary to construct an automated data quality engine: human readable reports, metrics in a form that can be processed automatically, and a raw mapping between input data points and the profile strings calculated. 


Example Output of a Human Readable Report:
(generated using the option  -v report='1')


file          column                 count 	 pattern
======= ===============              ===== 	 =======
out.tab col_00002_email              3300        aaaa_999_9.aaaaaaa@aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              1258        aaaaaa9aaaaa99999@aaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              810         aaaa_99_9.aaaaaaa@aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              720         aaaaa_99_9.aaaaaaa@aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              398         AAAA-AAAA-999@aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              382         aaaaaa9aaaaa9999@aaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              120         AA_AAA_AAA_99@aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              111         aaaaaaaaa.aa@aaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              108         aaaa.aa.aa9@aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              93          aaaaaaaaaaa99999@aaaaaaa.aaa
out.tab col_00002_email              92          Aaaa.Aaa@aaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaa


To interpret the output, an understanding of how the program generalises data into the pattern-string is useful. Below is a description of the two available algorithms you can select from when studying your data, the first resulting in a granular study of your data, and the second a more generalised study of your data. Note the default setting is to produce more granular output.


Highly Granular Pattern Construction:

For all data content, apply the following character level translation:
1) Translate all upper case characters in the data [A-Z] to becoming an "A"
2) Translate all lower case characters in the data [a-z] to an "a"
3) Translate all numbers in the data [0-9] to a "9"
4) Translate all tab marks to a "T"
5) Leave all remaining whitespace and high ASCII and punctuation as is 

For example, a field called Address, may contain raw data such as:

	John Smith, 33 High Street, Townford, Countyshire, UK, TC2 03R

which after transformation becomes:

        Aaaa Aaaaa, 99 Aaaa Aaaaaa, Aaaaaaaa, Aaaaaaaaaaa, AA, AA9 99A


Less Granular Pattern Construction

For all data content items, apply the following character level translation:
1) Translate all repeating occurrences of upper case characters [A-Z]+ to becoming an "A"
2) Translate all repeating occurrences of lower case characters [a-z]+ to an "a"
3) Translate all sequences of numbers in the data [0-9]+ to a "9"
4) Translate all tab marks to a "T"
5) Leave all remaining whitespace, high ASCII, and punctuation as is 


For example, a field called Address, may contain raw data such as:

	John Smith, 33 High Street, Townford, Countyshire, UK, TC2 03R

which after transformation becomes:

        Aa Aa, 9 Aa Aa, Aa, Aa, AA, A9 9A

Notice that the profile is more general using this rule, so the profiles match more occurances.  


Technology

The profiler is written in AWK, and the intended program to run it is GAWK. There is a very specific reason for this. AWK is a core part of the unix kernal, and as such, is both robust and ubiquitous in all types of computing environments. This means the profiler can be introduced to highly locked down production systems with no new software installation per se needed to run the scripts, and with minimal introduction of risk to the existing services hosted. 

In addition to code being able to run on any unix system, it can also be run on windows systems via 'nix emulators such as MKS (a 64-bit closed-source unix emulator for windows) or cygwin (a 32-bit open-source unix emulator for windows), both common in enterprise production environments.

If you wish to run this code in a JAVA environment, it is perhaps possible via the JAWK library. 


Input and Output Configuration options

The code has only a few simple configuration options carefully chosen to meet the needs of many. The three main output choices configurable are:

-v report ="0" -- (0) produce profile metrics data, directly loadable to a database or data quality rules engine
-v report ="1" -- (1) produce profile metrics text reports, in a format easily printed 
-v report ="2" -- (2) produce a modified copy of your input data, having additional columns containing the calculated profile strings that can be loaded directly to a database or fed into a data quality rules engine.

Option Notes:

For option (0), the profiler will generate a metrics file having 4 column tab delimited file having the following delimited file layout:
<filename><column_identifier><count><pattern>
where the column names specified in the header are prefixed with .col_<column_id>_. 

For option (1) the report output includes these same fields but formatted into a more readable layout as seen in the example given in the .What it does. section.

For option (2), the file will output the original data alongside new columns holding the calculated profiles. This is a critical output, as when a profile is found that needs investigation, this output can be used to find the matching raw data records of interest. The simplest was to do this is using filters in excel, but more sophisticated options are also available.


Command Line Options
The program can be called from the command line as follows in this example:

awk -F"\t" -f bytefreq_v1.04.awk -v header="1" -v report="1" -v grain="L" input.data > output.report.txt


Usage:

-F"\t"        Use the native -F option in AWK to set your input data file delimiter, also known as it's Field Separator, FS. 
The example above shows the setting for a tab delimited file, but there are many advanced field and record separator choices available if you read the AWK documentation.  


-f bytefreq_v1.01.awk        The -f option tells awk to run the profiler code. Be sure to include a fully qualified file path to the code if your working directory is not where the code is sitting. 


-v header="1"        The command line option to set the row to use to pick up the headers in the file. If you set this value to row 1, it will use the first row as the header row. If you set it to X, the code will use the Xth row to pick up headers and ignore all proceeding lines in the file, a feature that can occasionally be very handy. The default value if this setting if it is not explicitly set ion the command line s .0., meaning, no header record.
 
-v report="0"        Sets the output to a machine readable profile frequency dataset.
-v report="1"        Sets the output to a human readable profile frequency report.
-v report="2"        Sets the output to raw + profiled full volume data in a machine readable format.
-v grain="L"         Set the Less granular level of pattern formats in the output
-v grain="H"         Set the Highly granular level of pattern formats in the output


input.data          The file you wish to examine. Note if the working directory doesn't hold the file, you need to set this value to being the fully qualified path and file name.


> output.report.txt        This is the standard unix notation meaning .redirect the output to a file., which if not set means the profiler will output it.s metrics to STDOUT (standard out) be sure to use a fully qualified name if you wish the output to be written to a different folder.
